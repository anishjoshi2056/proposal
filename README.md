# Abstract 

The project entitled “Classified Advertising platform (SastoSaaman)” is a website for buying and selling items. Classified advertising is a form of advertising, particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals, which may be sold or distributed free of charge. Classified advertisements are much cheaper than larger display advertisements used by businesses. SastoSaaman is a free classifieds and online marketplace that helps users to sell, buy or discover anything across Nepal. This project is the combination of Online market place and Online Classified Advertising platform.Community members can come to our site to sell their old car, bike, music system, laptop or furniture,buy any item that they might want or have to offer and make new friends while doing all of the above.

# 1.Introduction(new)

Classified advertising is a form of advertising which is particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals, e.g., free ads on papers. Classified advertising allows private individuals (not simply companies or corporate entities) to try to sell products or services. Classified advertising is called that because it is generally grouped within the publication under headings classifying the product or service being offered (headings such as electronics, Automobiles, Clothing, For Sale, For Rent, etc.) and is grouped entirely in a distinct section of the periodical, which makes it distinct from display advertising, which often contains graphics or other art work and which is placed near to editorial content. 

Newspapers are continuing to make less and less money from classified advertising because more and more people are using the Internet now and fewer people are reading newspapers. 

Online classified advertising is one of the fastest-growing types of online advertising. Online classifieds are all about buying and selling a range of goods and services. Online classifieds could be categorised into automobiles, furniture, matrimony, recruitment, real estate, etc. 

Online classifieds could be of two types: Horizontal and Vertical. The horizontal classifieds include different products ranging from furniture, electronics, apparels, etc. The vertical classified is restricted to a single platform for instance LinkedIn which advertises different jobs and vacancies. 

The online classified market is expected to increase due to growth in the retail e-commerce industry, increase in a number of smartphone users, increasing internet penetration, growing global youth population, etc. Yet the market faces some challenges such as, need for technological barriers, developing country barriers, social media threat, etc. As the online classified advertising sector develops, there is an increasing emphasis toward specialization. 

# 2 Objective and scope
This encloses the needs and scope of the development of the project. The objectives can be explained as following:
# 2.1	Objectives
1    To make buying and selling of secondhand items easy and convenient.
2    To connect interested buyers and sellers.
3.   To provide information about various products in a different category.
4.   Customer can login and get various information about products and can purchase a suitable product with price and quality comparison.
5.   Customer can login and post information about the products they want to sell.
# 2.2 Scope
1.  Customers can buy and sell products online.
2.  This can be used as online marketplace and classified advertising platform.
3.  Buyers and Sellers are connected and  transaction are done through this site, this reduces the chances of fraud and scam.

# 3 Literature Review 
# 3.1 Background 
# 3.2 Existing Situation 
# 3.2.1 Proposed system
The proposed system aims online marketplace of classified advertising platform for buying and selling services and goods such as electronics, fashion items , furniture, household  goods, cars, bikes, stationary products etc. This system uses web service. The data (product details and users data ) are stored in database that will be the centre of all information. Web sever fetches data from database and show to the user as required or mentioned. The architecture of our proposed system is three tire architecture(data teir, application teir, presentation teir.) 

A simple block diagram has been presented here which gives some insight into the structure of the system. This block diagram is for illustration purpose. All the components of the system will be elaborated in final block diagram.

# 5.FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
For the system that is to be developed must satisfy all the feasible strategy.This step deals with the various types of the feasibilities that are needed to be considered during the system development. Mainly there are different types of feasibility that are needed to be considered and they are:
# 5.1 Technical feasibility
The necessary technology to develop our project "CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING PLATFORM ". Software like Node.js and MongoDB can be used to develop the back end which contains the actual database in which various information are stored which can be manipulated or retrieved as per the requirement. React.js front-end framework can be used to develop a user friendly interface to be used by the system user. Therefore the project team feels it is capable of making use of the available technology to build "CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING PLATFORM" website. Hence the system is technically feasible.
# 5.2 Economic Feasibility 
For any system if the expected benefits equal or exceed the expected costs, the system can be judged to be economically feasible. In economic feasibility, cost benefit analysis is done in which expected costs and benefits are evaluated. Economic analysis is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Developing an IT application is an investment. Since after developing that application it provides the organization with profits. Profits can be monetary or in the form of an improved working environment. However, it carries risks, because in some cases an estimate can be wrong. And the project might not actually turn out to be beneficial.
Cost benefit analysis helps to give management a picture of the costs, benefits and risks. It usually involves comparing alternate investments.
Cost benefit determines the benefits and savings that are expected from the system and compares them with the expected costs.
The cost of an information system involves the development cost and maintenance cost. The development costs are one time investment whereas maintenance costs are recurring. The development cost is basically the costs incurred during the various stages of the system development.

# 5.3 Operational Feasibility
Operational feasibility is mainly concerned with issues like whether the system will be used if it is developed and implemented. Whether there will be resistance from users that will effect the possible application benefits? The essential questions that help in testing the operational feasibility of a system are following.

Does management support the project?

Are the users not happy with current business practices? Will it reduce the time (operation) considerably? If yes, then they will welcome the change and the new system.

Have the users been involved in the planning and development of the project? Early involvement reduces the probability of resistance towards the new system.

Will the proposed system really benefit the organization? Does the overall response increase? Will accessibility of information be lost? Will the system effect the customers in considerable way?
